// The send method, which takes a Transaction, is used by the ATM
// side of the application to send a transaction to the Bank side of
// the application. It asks the Transaction to packetize itself.
// The Transaction will build a string in its argument address
// which has the format of a four-character type field (first four
// letters of the class's name, a seven-digit source account field,
// a space, a four-digit PIN, a space, a nine-digit
// floating-point field (stored in ASCII), and a NULL terminator).
// Some transactions may add additional info to the end of the
// record, e.g. the Transfer transaction adds the target account
// to the end of the string for later retrieval by the Network::receive()
// method below (which takes zero arguments).
// In this simulation, the method simply prints the packet it would
// send through the reader's favorite mechanism.
